# Final-Project
University of California Riverside annually selects 100 graduates to participate in Doctors without
Borders program. These physicians are matched based on specialized areas, language fluency and
preferences. Each pair of participants are given opportunity to aid on-site physicians for 60 days.
Currently, Doctors without Borders expand over 10 countries.
1. Determine the matches of participants in the program.
2. Create a C++ program that demonstrates match selection based on language and specialized
areas.
 At least 5 languages must be implemented for 10 country matches.
 At least 5 medical specialization must be implemented in the matches. See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)
3. Determine the probability of participants matching based on language fluency and
specialization. Program must display the matched probability.
4. Provide documentation that explains solution and programming approaches.
